"""QPX specification version and file-format compatibility guards.

Two distinct versions live in this project and must never be conflated:

* ``qpx._version.__version__`` — the **package** version (hatch-vcs, derived from
  the git tag; ``0.0.x`` in a dirty checkout, ``1.0.x`` on a release tag). It
  identifies the *software build* and moves on every release.
* :data:`QPX_SPEC_VERSION` — the **specification / on-disk format** version
  declared in ``docs/spec/versioning.md``. It moves only when the data model
  changes and is what gets stamped into the Parquet footer as ``qpx_version``.

Stamping the package version as ``qpx_version`` (the historical bug) meant a
file could never advertise the spec version a reader checks against.
