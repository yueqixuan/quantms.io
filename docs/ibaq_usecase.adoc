== IBAQ Usage

Users can now convert existing public datasets in PRIDE Archive to peptide features files using the quantms.io toolkit, remap the proteins to a new version of the UniProt database and recompute IBAQ values using ibaqpy after annotating the SDRF file. ibaqpy benefits from SDRF's compatibility with public proteomics repositories like PRIDE, facilitating seamless integration into submission workflows and downstream analyses. The use of SDRF automates the parsing of metadata, reducing manual effort and user error while enabling better cross-study comparisons.

==== quantms

nf-core/quantms is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for Quantitative Mass Spectrometry (MS). Currently, the workflow supports three major MS-based analytical methods: (i) Data dependant acquisition (DDA) label-free and Isobaric quantitation (e.g. TMT, iTRAQ); (ii) Data independent acquisition (DIA) label-free quantification.

===== Data dependant acquisition
In experiments analyzed using quantms with data-dependent acquisition, you need to download the following files:

* mzTab file: mzTab is intended as a lightweight supplement to the existing standard mzML to store and represent peptide and protein and identifications together with experimental metadata and basic quantitative information.
* MSstats file: MSstats is generated for all three pipelines DDA-LFQ, DDA-ISO and DIA-LFQ. A simple tsv file ready to be read by the OpenMStoMSstats function of the MSstats R package. It should hold the same quantities as the consensusXML but rearranged in a "long" table format with additional information about the experimental design used by MSstats.
* SDRF file: SDRF is a file format based on MAGE-TAB, designed to record sample metadata and the relationships between samples and data in proteomics experiments. The main purpose of SDRF is to enhance the interpretability and re-analyzability of proteomics data, as well as to facilitate integration with other omics data.

===== Data independent acquisition

The DIA experiment was processed by the DIANN software, and you need to obtain the `diann_report` file and the `SDRF` file. You also need to download all the mass spectrometry information.

==== MaxQuant

In MaxQuant, you need to download the `evidence` file and the `SDRF` file.

=== Map to the latest UniProt database

You can download the latest `UniProt FASTA` file to remap the peptides and proteins.

[source, shell]
----
quantmsioc transform uniprot \
--feature-file PXD048325-29419338-aa11-47fb-b183-db1650465b57.feature.parquet \
--fasta uniprotkb_Human_AND_reviewed_true_AND_m_2024_12_02.fasta \
--output-folder result \
--output-prefix PXD048325

=== Obtain a feature use case for calculating IBAQ

Finally, for use with `ibaqpy`, you need to inject experimental information into the `feature` file using the `SDRF` file.
