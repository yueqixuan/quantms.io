# Protein Group View

The protein group (PG) view is a tabular Parquet file that contains the details of protein groups identified and quantified per quantification unit. A quantification unit is the group of raw files aggregated together (`grouped_runs`) — a protein quantity only exists after aggregating peptides across a sample's fractions, so the view keys on this group of raw files rather than a single raw file (for unfractionated or DIA data the group is a single file). It captures the relationship between protein groups and the grouped runs in which they were detected, including peptide counts, feature counts, quality metrics, and intensity-based quantification. The sample is resolved downstream via `(any file in grouped_runs, label) -> run.samples[].sample_accession`.

This view is analogous to outputs from tools such as MaxQuant (`proteinGroups.txt`), DIA-NN (`pg_matrix`), and FragPipe protein group reports.

## Use cases

- Retrieve all protein groups identified or quantified in a given raw file.
- Retrieve protein group abundance by file and condition.
- Store and query FDR q-values for protein groups at both the run and experiment level.
- Support downstream statistical analysis by providing per-file protein-level quantification.

## Schema

Fields marked with **(PK)** are primary keys and MUST NOT be null. Fields marked with **(nullable)** may have null values. See the full YAML schema in [`pg.yaml`](schemas/pg.yaml).

### Identity

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `pg_accessions` | Protein accessions of all proteins within this group | `array[string]` | Yes |
| `pg_names` | Descriptive names for the proteins in the group | `array[string]` | No |
| `gg_accessions` | Gene group accessions as a string array | `array[string]` | No |
| `gg_names` | Gene names corresponding to the proteins in the group | `array[string]` | No |
| `gg_qvalue` | Gene group q-value (e.g., DIA-NN GG.Q.Value) | `float64`, null | No |
| `anchor_protein` | Representative protein of the group (leading protein) | `string` | Yes (PK) |
| `grouped_runs` | The group of raw files aggregated into one quantification unit (fractions aggregated together; single-element for unfractionated/DIA). The sample is resolved downstream via `(any file in grouped_runs, label) -> run.samples[].sample_accession` | `array[string]` | Yes (PK) |

### Counts

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `peptide_counts` | Peptide sequence counts for this protein group in this file | `struct` | No |
| `peptide_counts.unique_sequences` | Number of peptide sequences unique to this protein group within this file | `int` | -- |
| `peptide_counts.total_sequences` | Total number of peptide sequences identified for this protein group in this file | `int` | -- |
| `feature_counts` | Peptide feature counts (peptide-charge combinations) for this protein group | `struct` | No |
| `feature_counts.unique_features` | Number of unique peptide features specific to this protein group within this file | `int` | -- |
| `feature_counts.total_features` | Total number of peptide features identified for this protein group in this file | `int` | -- |

### Quality

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `global_qvalue` | Global q-value of the protein group at the experiment level | `float64` | No |
| `pg_qvalue` | Protein group q-value at the run level | `float64` | No |
| `is_decoy` | Whether the protein group is a decoy (`true`) or a target (`false`) | `bool` | Yes |
| `contaminant` | Contaminant flag | `bool`, null | No |
| `sequence_coverage` | Percentage of the protein sequence covered by identified peptides | `float32` | No |
| `molecular_weight` | Molecular weight of the protein in kDa | `float32` | No |

### Quantification

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `label` | Channel/label of this quantification (e.g., TMT126, LFQ); **one row per label**. Null for identification-only groups. Part of the primary key. | `string` | Yes (PK, nullable) |
| `intensity` | Primary raw intensity value for this label. Null for identification-only groups. | `float32` | No |
| `additional_intensities` | Pre-computed intensity values from the upstream tool (normalized, LFQ, iBAQ, etc.) for this row's label. See [Intensities](intensities.md) | `array[struct]` | No |
| `additional_scores` | Additional scores and metrics (posterior error probability, confidence, etc.). See [Scores](scores.md) | `array[struct]` | No |

Since QPX 1.1 the protein-group quantification is **flattened**: instead of an `intensities` list, each row carries a scalar `label` + `intensity`, so there is one row per `(anchor_protein, grouped_runs, label)`. Identification-only groups (no quantity) have null `label`/`intensity`.

Each entry in `additional_intensities` contains:

| Sub-field | Description | Type |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `label` | Label identifier (e.g., TMT126, LFQ) | `string` |
| `intensities` | Array of name-value pairs for derived intensities | `array[struct{intensity_name, intensity_value}]` |

### Peptide detail

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `peptides` | Number of peptides per individual protein in the protein group | `array[struct]` | Yes |

Each entry in `peptides` contains:

| Sub-field | Description | Type |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `protein_name` | Protein accession | `string` |
| `peptide_count` | Number of peptides for this protein | `int` |

### CV params

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `cv_params` | Optional list of controlled vocabulary parameters for additional metadata | `array[struct{cv_name, cv_value}]` | No |

## Recommended Intensity Names

The following names are commonly used in `additional_intensities` for the PG view. Use consistent naming so downstream tools can recognise them across datasets.

| `intensity_name` | Source tool(s) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `maxlfq` | DIA-NN, MaxQuant, FragPipe | MaxLFQ normalised protein group quantity |
| `lfq` | MaxQuant | Label-free quantification intensity |
| `ibaq` | MaxQuant | Intensity-based absolute quantification |
| `topn` | DIA-NN | Top-N normalised protein group quantity |
| `normalize_intensity` | quantms | Median-normalised intensity |
| `spectral_count` | FragPipe, MaxQuant | Number of PSMs for razor peptides |
| `unique_spectral_count` | FragPipe | Number of PSMs for unique peptides only |
| `total_spectral_count` | FragPipe | Number of PSMs for all peptides (razor + shared) |
| `genes_maxlfq` | DIA-NN | Gene-group level MaxLFQ quantity |
| `genes_maxlfq_unique` | DIA-NN | Gene-group MaxLFQ using only proteotypic peptides |
| `ratio_h_l` | MaxQuant (SILAC) | Heavy-to-light protein ratio |
| `ratio_h_l_normalized` | MaxQuant (SILAC) | Normalised heavy-to-light ratio |
| `reporter_intensity` | MaxQuant (TMT/iTRAQ) | Raw reporter-ion intensity |
| `reporter_intensity_corrected` | MaxQuant (TMT/iTRAQ) | Isotope-purity-corrected reporter intensity |

!!! tip "Spectral counts as intensities"
    Spectral counts are quantitative measures that vary per run and per label, so they fit naturally in `additional_intensities`. Store them as float values (e.g., `3.0` instead of `3`) since the struct uses `float32`.

!!! tip "Gene-group quantities"
    DIA-NN reports protein-group level (`PG.MaxLFQ`) and gene-group level (`Genes.MaxLFQ`) quantities separately. Store gene-group quantities in `additional_intensities` with names prefixed `genes_` (e.g., `genes_maxlfq`, `genes_maxlfq_unique`). The `gg_accessions` field identifies the gene group.

## Recommended Score Names

The following score names are commonly used in `additional_scores` for the PG view. For the full list of recommended score names and naming conventions, see [Scores](scores.md).

| `score_name` | Source tool(s) | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `posterior_error_probability` | MaxQuant | lower is better | Protein-group PEP |
| `andromeda_score` | MaxQuant | higher is better | Andromeda protein-level score |
| `protein_probability` | FragPipe | higher is better | ProteinProphet probability |
| `top_peptide_probability` | FragPipe | higher is better | Highest PeptideProphet probability among peptides |
| `pg_maxlfq_quality` | DIA-NN | higher is better | QuantUMS quality for PG.MaxLFQ estimate |
| `genes_maxlfq_quality` | DIA-NN | higher is better | QuantUMS quality for gene-level MaxLFQ |
| `pg_pep` | DIA-NN | lower is better | Posterior error probability at the protein group level |
| `gg_qvalue` | DIA-NN | lower is better | Gene group q-value |
| `lib_pg_qvalue` | DIA-NN | lower is better | Library protein group q-value |
| `protein_qvalue` | DIA-NN | lower is better | Unique protein q-value (proteotypic evidence) |

## Tool Mappings

This section shows how output columns from common search engines and pipelines map to `pg.parquet` fields.

!!! info "Wide-to-long conversion"
    MaxQuant, DIA-NN, and FragPipe output protein groups in **wide format** (one row per protein group, one column per experiment/run). QPX uses **long format** (one row per protein group **per quantification unit**). Converters must melt wide-format columns into separate rows keyed by `grouped_runs` (the group of raw files aggregated into one quantification unit; single-element for unfractionated/DIA).

!!! note "FragPipe q-values"
    FragPipe does not report explicit protein-group q-values. The `Protein Probability` (from ProteinProphet) is filtered at a given FDR threshold (typically 1%) before writing `combined_protein.tsv`. Set `global_qvalue` to null and store the probability in `additional_scores`.

## Notes

!!! note "Relationship to other views"
    The PG view provides per-file protein group quantification. For derived per-sample summaries (protein counts, abundances, etc.), see [API Views](views.md). For downstream absolute or differential expression results, see the [Absolute Expression](absolute.md) and [Differential Expression](differential.md) views.

!!! warning "Primary key constraints"
    The combination of `anchor_protein`, `grouped_runs`, and `label` forms the composite primary key. `anchor_protein` and `grouped_runs` MUST NOT be null. `label` is null **only** for identification-only protein groups that carry no quantity (e.g. mzIdentML); when a quantity exists, `label` is non-null and there is one row per label. `grouped_runs` is a **set of distinct raw files**: it MUST NOT contain duplicates, and two keys are equal when they contain the same files regardless of order (identity is compared set-wise). The list is **stored in fraction order** — sorting is not applied, because it would destroy fraction ordering (and lexicographically misorder names like `F1, F10, F2`). Each record represents a single protein group quantified in one quantification unit (the group of raw files/fractions aggregated together) for one label. A protein quantity only exists after aggregating peptides across a sample's fractions, so the PG view keys on this group of raw files, not a single raw file; for unfractionated or DIA data the list has a single element.

    Within one `(anchor_protein, label)`, the `grouped_runs` sets across rows MUST be **disjoint** — every raw file contributes to at most one row, so no measurement is counted twice (the *run-disjointness* invariant enforced by validation).
