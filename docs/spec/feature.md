# Feature View

The feature view captures quantified peptide information at the MS run level. Each row represents a peptide feature -- a quantified peptidoform in a specific run file -- including its intensity across labels and protein group mappings.

## Use Cases

- **Quantified peptide information**: Stores peptide intensities linked to sample metadata, enabling downstream quantitative analysis and integration with SDRF annotations.
- **Peptide-level statistics**: Enables algorithms that operate at the peptide level (e.g., peptide-to-protein rollup, normalization, missing value imputation).
- **Integration with sample metadata**: Each feature carries label information, connecting quantification data to experimental design described in the SDRF.

## Schema

|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `intensities` | Primary intensity-based abundance of the feature across labels | array[struct], null | no |
| `additional_intensities` | Pre-computed intensity values from the upstream tool (e.g., normalized, LFQ, iBAQ) as named key-value pairs per label | array[struct], null | no |
| `run_file_name` | The run file name that contains the feature | string | yes |

!!! tip "Intensity structure"
    For details on the `intensities` and `additional_intensities` data structures, including examples for LFQ and TMT experiments, see [Intensities](intensities.md).

### Protein Group Fields

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `pg_accessions` | Protein group accessions of all proteins that the peptide maps to | array[string], null | no |
| `anchor_protein` | One protein accession that represents the protein group | string | yes |
| `unique` | Whether the peptide maps uniquely to a single protein group | bool, null | no |
| `pg_positions` | Peptide start and end positions within each protein in the protein group | array[struct], null | no |
| `pg_global_qvalue` | Global q-value of the protein group at the experiment level | float64, null | optional |
| `gg_accessions` | Gene accessions associated with the protein group | array[string], null | optional |
| `gg_names` | Gene names associated with the protein group | array[string], null | optional |

Each entry in `pg_positions` contains:

| Sub-field | Description | Type |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| `protein_accession` | Protein accession within the protein group | `string` |
| `start` | 1-based start position of the peptide in the protein sequence | `int` |
| `end` | 1-based end position of the peptide in the protein sequence (inclusive) | `int` |

!!! note "Gene and protein inference data"
    Gene accessions, gene names, and unique peptide indicators are optionally included in the feature file for convenience. Protein-level scores are stored in the [Protein Group View](pg.md). For the complete protein-level perspective with aggregated intensities and peptide counts, join on `pg_accessions` + `run_file_name` with the PG view.

!!! info "Optional vs nullable"
    `pg_global_qvalue` is **optional** — the column may be absent from the file entirely if the search engine does not provide a protein group q-value. When present, individual values may be null.

### Spectra Reference

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `id_run_file_name` | The run file containing the best PSM that identified the feature (may differ from `run_file_name`) | string, null | no |
| `scan` | Scan identifier of the best PSM that identified the feature, as an array of integer components (e.g., `[43920]` for single-scan instruments, `[10, 1, 345]` for Waters function/process/scan) | array[int32] | yes |

## File Metadata

Feature Parquet files store file-level metadata as key-value pairs in the Parquet footer. The following metadata fields are defined:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `qpx_version` | Version of the QPX format used to generate the file |
| `software_provider` | Name and version of the software that generated the data |
| `scan_format` | Format of scan identifiers: `scan`, `index`, or `nativeId` |
| `creator` | Name of the tool or person who created the file |
| `file_type` | Type of the file (value: `feature_file`) |
| `creation_date` | Date when the file was created |
| `compression_format` | Compression algorithm used: `zstd` (default), `snappy`, `gzip`, `lzo`, or `none` |

!!! tip "Reading file metadata in Python"
    ```python
    import pyarrow.parquet as pq

    parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile("experiment.feature.parquet")
    metadata = parquet_file.schema_arrow.metadata
    for key, value in metadata.items():
        print(f"{key.decode()}: {value.decode()}")
    ```

## Notes

!!! note "Works for both DDA and DIA"
    Unlike the PSM view (which is DDA-specific), the feature view supports both DDA and DIA workflows. For DIA experiments, the feature view is the primary peptide-level output.

- **Relationship to PSM view**: A feature aggregates one or more PSMs into a single quantified peptide entry. The `scan` and `id_run_file_name` fields link back to the best PSM that identified the feature. In DDA-LFQ workflows, both views may exist; in DIA workflows, only the feature view is typically generated.
- **Relationship to protein group view**: The feature view contains protein group mappings (`pg_accessions`, `anchor_protein`) and peptide positions (`pg_positions`) that connect each peptide to its inferred protein groups. Gene annotations, unique peptide indicators, and protein-level scores are stored in the [Protein Group View](pg.md). The PG view provides the complete protein-level perspective with aggregated intensities and peptide counts.
- **Intensities vs additional_intensities**: Use `intensities` for raw/primary measurements across experimental labels (TMT/iTRAQ tags or LFQ). Use `additional_intensities` for values pre-computed by the upstream tool (e.g., normalized intensities, LFQ, iBAQ). QPX reads these from the tool's output — it does not compute them. This separation keeps experimental design aspects distinct from data processing aspects.
- **Protein group accessions**: The `pg_accessions` field should contain all proteins within a protein group. The `anchor_protein` is the representative protein selected by the search engine or inference algorithm to represent the group. The `pg_positions` field maps the peptide's start and end coordinates within each protein in the group.
