# Versioning

QPX uses a simple versioning scheme to track specification changes and ensure that tools can correctly interpret files produced by different versions of the format.

## Version Format

QPX versions follow a **`{major}.{minor}`** format -- for example, **1.0**.

This is a two-component scheme without patch numbers. The version applies to the entire QPX specification, not to individual views.

## Rules

- **Major releases** (`X.0`): Reserved for large-scale, backward-incompatible restructuring of the data model once the format is declared stable.
- **Minor updates** (`1.X`): The active line of development while the format stabilises. Minor updates normally add backward-compatible fields, views, or metadata keys, but **may also carry backward-incompatible changes** (removing or renaming a field, changing a field type) during the pre-2.0 stabilisation period. Every such change is called out in the [changelog](#changelog) below, and tools should check the `qpx_version` in the file footer and consult the changelog rather than assuming minor updates are always compatible.

!!! warning "Pre-2.0 stabilisation"
    While QPX is on the `1.x` line the specification is still stabilising, so a
    minor release may change the data model in a backward-incompatible way. Pin
    the `qpx_version` you target and read the changelog before upgrading. Once the
    format is declared stable the strict "minor = additive only" rule takes over
    and breaking changes move to a major (`2.0`) release.

!!! note
    QPX does not use patch versions. Bug fixes to the specification text that do not change the data model are tracked in the documentation changelog but do not increment the version number.

## Version in Files

All QPX views (PSM, Feature, PG, Peptide, Protein, MZ, and others serialized as Parquet) include a `qpx_version` field in their file-level metadata. This metadata is stored as a key-value pair in the Parquet file footer and identifies which version of the QPX specification was used to generate the file.

```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

# Writing a file with version metadata
metadata = {"qpx_version": "1.0"}
```

!!! tip "Reading the version from a file"
    ```python
    import pyarrow.parquet as pq

    parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile("experiment.psm.parquet")
    schema_metadata = parquet_file.schema_arrow.metadata
    qpx_version = schema_metadata.get(b"qpx_version", b"unknown").decode()
    print(f"QPX version: {qpx_version}")
    ```

## Current Version

The current QPX specification version is **1.1**.

This version defines all core views (PSM, Feature, PG, Peptide, Protein, MZ), expression views (Absolute, Differential), and metadata views (SDRF, Project).

### Changelog

- **1.1** (backward-incompatible, pre-2.0 stabilisation): the PG view now keys on
  `grouped_runs` (`list<string>`) instead of the scalar `run_file_name`. A
  protein-group quantity applies to the set of raw files (fractions) aggregated
  into one quantification unit, not a single file; the sample is resolved via
  `(any file in grouped_runs, label) -> run.samples[]`. This removes and retypes
  a field, so files written by 1.1 are **not** readable by strict 1.0 tooling —
  shipped as a minor under the pre-2.0 stabilisation rule above. The Feature and
  PSM views keep the scalar `run_file_name`.
- **1.0**: initial specification.

## Software Provider

In addition to the specification version, every QPX file records the software that generated the data. This is stored in the `software_provider` metadata field in the Parquet file footer. The value identifies the tool name and version that produced the file:

```json
{
  "software_provider": {
    "name": "quantms",
    "version": "1.3.0"
  }
}
```

!!! info "Why track the software provider?"
    Tracking the generating software enables reproducibility and debugging. If a downstream analysis produces unexpected results, the software provider metadata allows users to determine which tool version created the input data and whether known issues apply.

The `software_provider` field is a free-text string in the Parquet metadata. The JSON structure shown above is the recommended format, but tools may also use a flat string such as `"QuantMS 1.3.0"`.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

| Reader Version | File Version | Compatible? | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| 1.0 | 1.0 | Yes | Exact match |
| 1.1 | 1.0 | Yes | Reader is newer, can handle older files |
| 1.0 | 1.1 | Yes | Reader ignores unknown optional fields |
| 2.0 | 1.0 | Maybe | Major version change; check migration guide |
| 1.0 | 2.0 | No | Reader cannot handle breaking changes |
