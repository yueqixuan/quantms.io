# PSM View

The PSM (Peptide Spectrum Match) view captures spectrum-level identification results. Each row represents a single match between a mass spectrum and a peptide sequence, including the identification scores, optional spectral data, and protein mappings.

## Use Cases

- **AI/ML training**: Provides peptide-spectrum pairs with optional spectral arrays (m/z, intensity, ion types) for training intensity prediction, de novo sequencing, and clustering models.
- **Spectrum-level analysis**: Enables detailed inspection of individual identifications, including retention time, charge state, and search engine scores.
- **DDA identification results**: Designed primarily for data-dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows where each spectrum yields one or more peptide identifications.

## Schema

### Core Identification Fields

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `sequence` | Unmodified peptide amino acid sequence | string | yes |
| `peptidoform` | Peptide sequence with modifications in ProForma notation | string | yes |
| `modifications` | Structured list of modifications with name, accession, position, and localization scores | array[struct], null | no |
| `charge` | Charge state of the precursor ion | int16 | yes |
| `posterior_error_probability` | Posterior error probability (PEP) for the peptide-spectrum match — the probability that the PSM is incorrect. **Lower values indicate higher confidence** (lower is better). Ranges from 0.0 (confident) to 1.0 (likely incorrect) | float64, null | no |
| `is_decoy` | Whether the PSM is a decoy match (`true`) or a target match (`false`) | bool | yes |
| `calculated_mz` | Theoretical peptide mass-to-charge ratio based on identified sequence and modifications | float32 | yes |
| `observed_mz` | Experimental observed peptide mass-to-charge ratio | float32 | yes |
| `mass_error_ppm` | Mass error in ppm: 1e6 × (observed_mz − calculated_mz) / calculated_mz | float32, null | no |
| `missed_cleavages` | Number of missed enzymatic cleavages | int16, null | no |
| `rt` | MS2 scan's retention time (in seconds) | float32, null | no |
| `predicted_rt` | Predicted retention time of the peptide (in seconds) | float32, null | no |
| `run_file_name` | Spectrum file name without path or extension | string | yes |
| `scan` | Scan identifier as an array of integer components (e.g., `[43920]` for single-scan instruments, `[10, 1, 345]` for Waters function/process/scan) | array[int32] | yes |
| `additional_scores` | List of score structures with name, value, and direction indicator | array[struct], null | no |
| `cv_params` | Optional list of controlled vocabulary parameters for additional metadata | array[struct], null | no |

### Optional Fields

These fields are optional and may not exist in the file at all. They are included based on conversion settings or user preference.

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `protein_accessions` | Protein accessions of all proteins that the peptide maps to. Optional because protein mapping can be recovered from the feature and protein group views | array[string], null | no |
| `cross_links` | Cross-link information for XL-MS experiments. Each entry describes one cross-link site. `null` for non-cross-linked PSMs | array[struct], null | no |
| `ion_mobility` | Ion mobility value for the precursor ion | float32, null | no |
| `mz_array` | Array of m/z values for the spectrum | array[float32], null | no |
| `intensity_array` | Array of intensity values for the spectrum | array[float32], null | no |
| `charge_array` | Array of fragment ion charge values | array[int32], null | no |
| `ion_type_array` | Array of fragment ion type annotations (e.g., b, y, a) | array[string], null | no |
| `ion_mobility_array` | Array of fragment ion mobility values | array[float32], null | no |

!!! note "Nullable vs Optional"
    Core fields marked as "not required" are **nullable** -- the column always exists in the file but individual values may be null. Optional fields (protein accessions, spectral data) may be **absent from the file entirely**, depending on conversion settings. Protein mappings can be recovered by joining with the feature and protein group views.

### Cross-Linking Fields

The `cross_links` field supports XL-MS (cross-linking mass spectrometry) experiments following the mzIdentML 1.3 specification. Each entry in the array represents one cross-link site.

| Field | Description | Type | Required |
|-------|-------------|------|----------|
| `xl_type` | Type of cross-link: `"inter"` (between two peptides), `"intra"` (within same peptide), or `"dead-end"` (one reactive end) | string | yes |
| `partner_sequence` | Plain amino acid sequence of the beta (partner) peptide. `null` for dead-end and intra-peptide links | string, null | no |
| `partner_peptidoform` | Beta peptide in ProForma notation. `null` for dead-end and intra-peptide links | string, null | no |
| `donor_position` | Cross-link attachment position on the alpha peptide (1-indexed) | int32 | yes |
| `acceptor_position` | Attachment position on the beta peptide (1-indexed). `null` for dead-end links | int32, null | no |
| `linker_name` | Name of the cross-linker reagent (e.g., `"DSS"`, `"BS3"`, `"DSSO"`) | string | yes |
| `linker_accession` | XLMOD controlled vocabulary accession for the linker (e.g., `"XLMOD:02001"`) | string, null | no |
| `linker_mass` | Cross-linker mass in Daltons | float64 | yes |

!!! example "Cross-linked PSM"
    ```json
    {
      "sequence": "AAKPEPTIDER",
      "cross_links": [
        {
          "xl_type": "inter",
          "partner_sequence": "LKSEQUENCER",
          "partner_peptidoform": "LKSEQUENCER",
          "donor_position": 3,
          "acceptor_position": 2,
          "linker_name": "DSS",
          "linker_accession": "XLMOD:02001",
          "linker_mass": 138.0681
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

!!! note "Non-cross-linked PSMs"
    For regular (non-XL) PSMs, the `cross_links` field is `null`. This keeps the schema clean -- the struct-based design adds no overhead for non-cross-linked datasets.

## Shared Fields

Several fields in the PSM view use structures shared across other QPX views:

- For details on the `modifications` field structure, see [Modifications](modifications.md).
- For details on `additional_scores` and score semantics, see [Scores](scores.md).
- For details on `cv_params` usage and recommended terms, see [Scores & CV Terms](scores.md).

## File Metadata

PSM Parquet files store file-level metadata as key-value pairs in the Parquet footer. The following metadata fields are defined:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `qpx_version` | Version of the QPX format used to generate the file |
| `software_provider` | Name and version of the software that generated the data |
| `scan_format` | Format of scan identifiers: `scan`, `index`, or `nativeId` |
| `creator` | Name of the tool or person who created the file |
| `file_type` | Type of the file (value: `psm_file`) |
| `creation_date` | Date when the file was created |
| `compression_format` | Compression algorithm used: `zstd` (default), `snappy`, `gzip`, `lzo`, or `none` |

!!! tip "Reading file metadata in Python"
    ```python
    import pyarrow.parquet as pq

    parquet_file = pq.ParquetFile("experiment.psm.parquet")
    metadata = parquet_file.schema_arrow.metadata
    for key, value in metadata.items():
        print(f"{key.decode()}: {value.decode()}")
    ```

## Notes

!!! warning "DDA-specific view"
    The PSM view is designed primarily for **DDA** (data-dependent acquisition) methods. It is **not recommended** for DIA experiments, where the feature view should be used instead. Generating a PSM file for DIA data would produce duplicated information relative to the feature view.

!!! note "PEP is a PSM-level metric"
    `posterior_error_probability` is defined only in the PSM view. It represents the probability that a *specific* peptide-spectrum match is incorrect (lower is better). All major tools export PEP as P(incorrect): Percolator (`posterior_error_prob`), MaxQuant (`PEP`). FragPipe exports PeptideProphet Probability (P(correct)), so converters must compute `PEP = 1 - probability`. The feature and peptide views do not carry PEP as a top-level field; use `additional_scores` or `best_id_score` if a derived PEP value is needed at those levels.

- **Relationship to feature view**: The PSM view captures individual spectrum matches, while the [Feature View](feature.md) aggregates these into quantified peptide features with intensity data. A single feature may correspond to multiple PSMs across different scans.
- **Protein inference**: Protein inference results should not be the primary focus of the PSM view. `protein_accessions` is an **optional** column — protein mappings can be recovered by joining through the feature and protein group views. When included, it is useful for peptide filtering and protein-level browsing. For full protein group information, use the protein group (PG) view.
- **Spectral arrays**: The `mz_array` and `intensity_array` are parallel arrays of the same length. For large-scale spectral storage, the dedicated mass spectra (mz) view is recommended.
- **Recommended additional scores**: `global_qvalue` (experiment-level PSM q-value), `rank` (peptide rank in search results), and `pg_global_qvalue` (protein group q-value used for filtering).
