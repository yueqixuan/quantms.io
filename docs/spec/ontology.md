# Field Ontology Mapping

QPX fields are mapped to controlled vocabulary (CV) and ontology terms where applicable. This mapping provides formal semantic definitions for each field, enabling interoperability with proteomics standards, biological databases, and data management platforms like lamindb.

!!! important "snake_case everywhere"
    All QPX field names and score names use **snake_case** -- no colons, dots, spaces, or mixed case. This ensures every name is a valid identifier in SQL, Python, R, and any query language without quoting. The proper ontology term name (e.g., `Comet:xcorr` for `comet_xcorr`) and accession (e.g., `MS:1002252`) are stored in this mapping.

QPX uses three categories of ontologies:

1. **PSI-MS** ([MS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ms)) -- mass spectrometry terms for instrument, acquisition, and identification fields.
2. **Biological ontologies** -- for sample metadata fields: NCBI Taxonomy, UBERON, EFO/MONDO, Cell Ontology, etc.
3. **UniMod** ([UNIMOD](https://www.unimod.org/)) -- for post-translational modification definitions.

!!! info "Fields without ontology mappings"
    Fields with blank ontology entries are QPX-specific fields without standardized CV terms. These fields are defined entirely by the QPX specification.

## `ontology.parquet` -- machine-readable mapping {#ontology-parquet}

Each QPX dataset includes an `ontology.parquet` file that stores the field-to-ontology mapping in a queryable format. This makes the dataset self-describing -- any consumer can look up the proper ontology term for any field or score name without external documentation.

See the full YAML schema in [`ontology.yaml`](schemas/ontology.yaml).

### Schema

```python
import pyarrow as pa

ontology_schema = pa.schema(
    [
        pa.field("field_name", pa.string()),  # snake_case QPX field name (e.g. "comet_xcorr")
        pa.field("ontology_name", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # proper ontology term (e.g. "Comet:xcorr")
        pa.field("ontology_accession", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # CV accession (e.g. "MS:1002252")
        pa.field("ontology_source", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # ontology prefix (e.g. "MS", "UBERON", "UNIMOD")
        pa.field("ontology_version", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # version of the ontology (e.g. "4.1.235")
        pa.field("view", pa.string()),  # which view (e.g. "psm", "feature", "sample")
        pa.field("description", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # human-readable description
        pa.field("source_column_name", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # original column name in tool output
        pa.field("source_tool", pa.string(), nullable=True),  # tool that produced this field
    ]
)
```

### Example rows

### Querying

```sql
-- Look up the ontology term for a field
SELECT ontology_name, ontology_accession
FROM 'PXD014414.ontology.parquet'
WHERE field_name = 'comet_xcorr';

-- All fields with PSI-MS mappings
SELECT field_name, ontology_name, ontology_accession
FROM 'PXD014414.ontology.parquet'
WHERE ontology_source = 'MS';

-- All sample metadata ontology mappings
SELECT field_name, ontology_name, ontology_source
FROM 'PXD014414.ontology.parquet'
WHERE view = 'sample';
```

## Sample Metadata (`sample.parquet`) {#sample}

Sample metadata fields map to biological ontologies. These mappings are critical for integration with lamindb/bionty and for validating annotations against community-standard registries.

!!! tip "lamindb / bionty compatibility"
    Each sample metadata field maps to a bionty registry:

    | QPX field | bionty registry | Example validation |
    |---|---|---|
    | `organism` | `bt.Organism` | `bt.Organism.from_source(name="Homo sapiens")` |
    | `organism_part` | `bt.Tissue` | `bt.Tissue.from_source(name="heart")` |
    | `disease` | `bt.Disease` | `bt.Disease.from_source(name="breast cancer")` |

## Compatibility with lamindb and AnnData {#compatibility}

### AnnData

The QPX expression views (`ae.h5ad`, `de.h5ad`) use AnnData natively. The ontology mapping provides semantic definitions for the `.obs` (sample) and `.var` (protein/gene) slots:

| AnnData slot | QPX source | Ontology-backed fields |
|---|---|---|
| `.obs` | `sample.parquet` | `organism` (NCBITaxon), `organism_part` (UBERON), `disease` (EFO/MONDO), `cell_type` (CL), `cell_line` (Cellosaurus), `sex` (PATO) |
| `.var` | `pg.parquet` | `protein` (UniProt), `gene_name` (HGNC/Ensembl) |
| `.uns` | `dataset.parquet` | `project_accession`, `qpx_version` |

When building AnnData objects from QPX Parquet files, the `.obs` columns inherit the ontology definitions from `sample.parquet`. This means any AnnData created from QPX data carries structured, ontology-backed annotations that tools like scanpy and lamindb can validate.

### lamindb / bionty

[lamindb](https://lamin.ai/) uses [bionty](https://lamin.ai/docs/bionty) registries to validate biological entities. QPX's sample metadata fields map directly to bionty registries:

| QPX field | bionty registry | Ontology source | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `organism` | `bt.Organism` | NCBI Taxonomy | `Homo sapiens` → NCBITaxon:9606 |
| `organism_part` | `bt.Tissue` | UBERON | `heart` → UBERON:0000948 |
| `disease` | `bt.Disease` | MONDO | `breast cancer` → MONDO:0007254 |
| `cell_type` | `bt.CellType` | Cell Ontology | `T cell` → CL:0000084 |
| `cell_line` | `bt.CellLine` | Cellosaurus | `HeLa` → CVCL_0030 |
| `sex` | --- | PATO | `female` → PATO:0000383 |
| `developmental_stage` | `bt.DevelopmentalStage` | HsapDv | --- |

This means QPX datasets can be registered in lamindb with validated, ontology-backed annotations:

```python
import lamindb as ln
import bionty as bt
import anndata as ad

# Read QPX AnnData
adata = ad.read_h5ad("PXD014414.ae.h5ad")

# Validate against bionty registries
bt.Organism.from_source(name="Homo sapiens")
bt.Tissue.from_source(name="heart")
bt.Disease.from_source(name="breast cancer")

# Register as a lamindb artifact with validated metadata
artifact = ln.Artifact.from_anndata(adata, description="PXD014414 absolute expression")
artifact.save()
```

### Parquet views and lamindb

The Parquet data views (`psm`, `feature`, `pg`, `mz`) can also be registered as lamindb artifacts. The ontology mapping allows lamindb to understand what each field represents:

```python
import lamindb as ln

# Register Parquet files as artifacts
artifact = ln.Artifact("PXD014414.feature.parquet", description="PXD014414 features")
artifact.save()

# Link to biological context via validated sample metadata
artifact.organisms.add(bt.Organism.from_source(name="Homo sapiens"))
artifact.tissues.add(bt.Tissue.from_source(name="heart"))
```

The key benefit: because QPX defines clear ontology mappings for sample metadata, lamindb can automatically validate and link QPX datasets to the correct biological entities in its registry. No manual curation of field semantics is needed.
